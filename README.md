# Pet-Finder-DC
Using the Petpy package and the PetFinder API we will be practicing some data skills to find me a pet!

Please reference on how to download and use Aaron Schlegel's Petpy - Python Wrapper for the Petfinder API for any confusion on how to easily interact with PetFinder's API after you create an account with PetFinder.

This ReadME will be expanded on in the future.
